# Todo
A sample react native project for learning best React patterns and practices, built on top of react-native 0.67 version, using local authentication

## Setup

First things first, you're going to need to get setup so you can compile and run a React Native app. Follow the instructions
at [https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for your computer's OS (Windows/Mac)
and your mobile device's OS (iOS/Android). Make sure you selct `React Native CLI Quickstart` (not `Expo CLI Quickstart`). Follow that
guide until you reach the "Creating a new application" heading.

Once everything is setup you can clone this repository (or download the files) and you'll be ready to run this demo app.

**Option 1: Clone this repo**

Open your command line and move to the directory where you want to store the files:
```sh
cd [DIRECTORY NAME]

git clone https://github.com/vision72/Todo.git
```


### Installation

Now you just need to install all the apps dependencies and start it up.

If you have Yarn installed, run this command in the terminal:

```sh
yarn install
```

If not, you can run:

```sh
npm install
```

They both do the same thing so just pick one.

Once that's done running you're good to go. Run this command to get your app running on either iOS or Android:

```sh
npx react-native run-android

npx react-native run-ios
```


### Documentation

There's a lot going on here so you'll want to have some documentation links handy:

React Native: [https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

Javascript: [https://devdocs.io/javascript/](https://devdocs.io/javascript/)

React Native Express: [https://www.reactnative.express/](https://www.reactnative.express/) this is a great resource for learning the ins and
outs of React Native. As you get further into your app development this will be a useful resource for learning "the right way to do it".
